Description: The R package includes functions to perform partical correlation screening to control the false positive rate better. 
   The approach consists of two steps: First, it estimates an undirected network using one of the three state-of-the-art 
   estimation approaches: nodewise regression using lasso, Glasso and SPACE. Second, it detects the false positives, 
   by flagging the partial correlations that are smaller in absolute value than a given threshold, 
   which is determined through cross-validation; the flagged correlations are set to zero.
